# Thaumaturgic-Machinations

https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Thaumaturgic-Machinations

Thaumaturgy is the practice of performing miracles. In this case, magic!
All items are made up of different aspects, which can be distilled into a liquid form called essentia.
A skilled mage can manipulate this essentia to do practically anything the heart desires!

This mod adds new things to vanilla, to build alongside your vanilla structures.
-Break down items into various magical essences (essentia) which can be mixed and combined to make new things
-New Modules
-New Assembling Machines
-A Whole new set of power armor
-New Weapons
-New Boilers

Feel free to message me if you have sprites you want to add to this mod. If you do, I will credit you in the item's description.

I'm always on the factorio discord if you want to talk about the mod!
